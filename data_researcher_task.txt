Using Python, implement a small script that can be used to download the Consumer Expenditure Public Use Microdata (PUMD) from the Bureau of Labor statistics for an arbitrary year.

At minimum, the script should require a year as an input. It should run non-interactively. All data is available on the BLS website: https://www.bls.gov

The script should perform the following tasks:
1. Download the "Diary" PUMD file for the requested year in CSV format.
2. Extract the first file prefixed with 'expd'; for example, 'expd161.csv' for the 2016 data.
3. Print all distinct values for the 'NEWID' column in the expd file.
4. Compress the expd file in a new zip archive. The archive name should be the file name with an additional zip extension, for example 'expd161.csv.zip'
